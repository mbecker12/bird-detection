Perform transfer learning for object detection.


Description
===========

This project aims to perform object detection as a foundation for future work with Universeum GÃ¶teborg.
In this stage of the project, detection and recognition of different exotic bird species should be performed.

Note
====

The code has been written in Python 3.8.5. 

Needed to downgrade torch to 1.5 (and torchvision to 0.6 for compatibility) for some issues that arose with the custom data loaders.

The environment can be set up with e.g.

  virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.8 ~/virtualenv/dmlproj
  source ${HOME}/virtualenv/dmlproj/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  
For additional test support, when in the environment, execute

  pip install -r test-requirements.txt


This project has been set up using PyScaffold 3.2.3. For details and usage
