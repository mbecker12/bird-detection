# TODO: models expect pixel values in [0, 1]
# edit: before it's normalizing the images itself
# and not as previously assumed in [-1, 1]

# Also, boxes might need to be redefined
# to 0 < x < W, 0 < y < H


# FasterRCNN takes input arguments
#   image_mean and image_std
# Then, it seems like the images don't need to be
# normalized in the augmentation pipeline,
# but they should be in the range of [0, 1]
#
# for mobilenet_v2:
# mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
